# Traffic_Sign_Classifier
This repository is the code and writeup of the Traffic Sign Recognition project. We apply Deep Learning and Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) to the task of traffic sign classification as part of the SELF-DRIVING CAR nanodegree program. The project is broken down into three steps, which are: Step 1 Data Set Summary &amp; Exploration, Step 2 Design and Test a Model Architecture, Step 3 Test a Model on New Images. Beyond the initial requirements, I also implemented the Tensorboard features: embedding visualizer, summary{images, loss, accuracy, weights, biais}, a comparaison of different architectures, and compared the model result with Google Images search. Here, you will find the PROJECT SPECIFICATION and the PROJECT CODE.
